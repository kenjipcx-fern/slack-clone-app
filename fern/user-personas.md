## "5 Whys" Analysis

**Problem**: Teams struggle with effective remote communication

1. **Why?** Because text messages lack emotional context and quick voice calls are hard to initiate
2. **Why?** Because existing tools separate messaging and calling, creating friction
3. **Why?** Because they were designed for different use cases (formal meetings vs casual chat)
4. **Why?** Because the tools don't understand the spectrum of communication needs
5. **Why?** Because they optimize for features over workflow integration

**Root Problem**: Communication tools don't seamlessly blend async text with sync voice/video based on context and urgency.
